This post was originally written a few days ago, sorry about that. Haven’t really been up to writing lately, since I’ve literally had my hands full of work here.

I’ll start straight out; the past days after arriving at Minga Village have been the best days of my life so far. There’s only a handful of days left until my work ends there and the second part of my trip begins, but in a way, I’d like to extend my stay at the farm.

Due to the lack of updates recently, I’ll give you the full run-up of what’s gone down. I’ve been doing voluntary work, via an organization called WWOOF, in Minga Village, located in Ohmi-Takashima, next to lake Biwa.

Minga Village is an international project for autistic people, a kind of “healing therapy”—or more easily put, a place to escape the world’s stress. The Minga branch is run by a family of four, with a few WWOOFers helping out with different things around the house and outside.

And with “different things”, I *really* mean different things. What the household does is pretty impressing to somebody who was mainly stayed in the City for all my adulthood. This means almost all vegetables we eat are of our own produce. This produce is also sold, and grown without pesticides or insecticides. Instead of milk we use organic soy milk, the oil used is self-pressed rapeseed oil (which tastes really good on self-baked bread, by the way) and the hot water is boiled once a day by wood. Oh yeah and all of the drinking water is also spring water we get from a local well.

At first glance it seems like a really primitive environment (there is electricity though) and many of my friends have wondered; “What do you do on your free time?”. I didn’t really think of this before, but I just realized it’s the same as I’ve done home in Finland when going to the countryside. It takes a few days to get out of the stressed city mode and into the Chill-the-Fuck-Out -mode, and after that, your mind really starts to work like it should be, taking its own time.

Even though I might’ve put emphasis on the “relax and chill out” part, there’s no slacking involved. On the contrary, I’ve probably never worked as hard in my life as in the past days after arriving here. Tasks including planting herbs and new sprouts, picking weeds, harvesting vegetables, putting mulch and fertilizer on sprouts. I kid you not, but every single day my clothes have literally been soaked out of my own sweat. And the really awesome part of this is; I love it. And I wouldn’t want to have it any other way.

In the past week and a half, I’ve learned a lot of new things that have made me appreciate this kind of work more and already started getting thoughts fly around in my head, in a good way. Hell, I’m this close in changing my return date so I could stay for longer. And on this note, this has been the best spiritual restart of my life.

Oh yeah, on another note, I was initially supposed to get my rental SIM card after arriving, but seems like my iPhone was carrier locked. I’m on the way back to the airport to try again, now after prying the carrier lock off of my phone. Screw you, Sonera.

**EDIT:** In the end, I didn’t get that rental SIM after all. I got a prepaid SIM card and a new phone instead. Now I can use mail. ♡

I might not make it in time, but after I get this sorted, I’ll be going to listen to some live jazz to Gion-Pickup, where a good friend of mine is playing as bassist. Can’t wait.
