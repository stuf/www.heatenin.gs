Thinking back, everything feels very weird and surreal. In a couple of weeks time, I have been officially working at [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com) for a whopping four months. On top of that, in a couple of weeks time as well, I will be packing (most of) my things and relocating to live in the vicinity of Oslo, Norway.

Back in the end of January, 2015, a friend of mine posted about an open position about devops. A question, half-jokingly, "Hey man, can I come work for you?", got my subconsciousness wondering _"what if?"_. I was pretty happy with my job back then; it was fulfilling, I had really good and talented colleagues at work, management was also around to know where we're going, and the pay wasn't bad&mdash;the pay _could_ have been better, but I was happier with the work&ndash;stress -balance. Money is of no use in your grave.

I'm not entirely sure what the single thing was, but slowly, I started realizing that I wasn't maybe entirely happy with my situation. It turned into a slight moral dilemma for me&mdash;I didn't want to admit that I wasn't entirely happy. I mean, I didn't want to let anyone down at work by leaving&mdash;it felt more like a betrayal of sorts, perhaps. But the situation wasn't acute, so I let the thought of changing jobs mature for a week or two.

Having gotten my life massively back on track the past couple of years, I realized I wanted to be more ambitious. Having found mathematics actually doable and sensible&mdash;something that wasn't the case in school&mdash;I started getting into implementing simple sorting algorithms in Erlang and Haskell (to name a few), languages that I had _zero_ experience in. With the help of my girlfriend, I had a sudden realization; I didn't want to be _just_ a front-end developer, and, as corny as it sounds, I asked myself this: _can I see myself doing this for a living after two years?_

When the answer wasn't really clear, I was a bit startled; I took a lot of the things for granted, but was on track to being more satisfied with who I am.

I ended up sending my cover letter and resum√©, I had a couple of video interviews, and all of a sudden I was offered a job. _Shit was getting real_. I had no idea if the job I was being offered was good. Is the pay okay? Can I survive with it? _I'm going to have to move to another country_. And so on. How would I be able to find out about this stuff?

So, I spoke with a very good friend of mine, who went to work to Saudi Arabia, about what it's like to move abroad. Of course, Saudi Arabia _is a slight bit more different_ than Norway, compared to Finland. There are a lot of things that I've taken for granted, that I'd have to consider leaving behind; my parents, my sister, girlfriend, friends. Of course, nothing is permanent; my girlfriend will be moving after she graduates from University.
